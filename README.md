I am currently serving as the Lead Code Instructor and Assistant Center Director
at Code Ninjas. In these roles, I am responsible for overseeing student success
and center management. My primary objective is to ensure that every student
receives a high-quality education to excel in their programming education.
Additionally, I provide mentorship, coaching, and support to both students and
fellow instructors. Lastly, I strive to create a positive and conducive learning
environment for all.

I have trained over 1,000 students in video game and web development utilizing
various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Lua, and C# Unity

I will soon transition into a Web Developer role at IdeaBank Marketing. This role allows me to work in a team to develop high-quality websites for clients that will not only fulfill but also exceed their expectations
