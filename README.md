I am currently serving as the Lead Code Instructor and Assistant Center Director
at Code Ninjas. In these roles, I am responsible for overseeing student success
and center management. My primary objective is to ensure that every student
receives a high-quality education to excel in their programming education.
Additionally, I provide mentorship, coaching, and support to both students and
fellow instructors. Lastly, I strive to create a positive and conducive learning
environment for all.

I have trained over 1,000 students in video game and web development utilizing
various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Lua, and C# Unity

bachelor's degree in computer science. I also recently graduated from Bloomtech
with a certificate in full-stack development

### What I'm looking for

🖥️ I aspire to be a frontend developer or a full-stack developer! I love these
roles because they allow me to express my creativity in the applications that I
develop. If you work on an awesome team and are looking for your next teammate,
I'd love to hear from you
